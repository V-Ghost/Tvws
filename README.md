# Ghana TV White Space (TVWS) Geo-Database

## Overview

This repository contains a prototype implementation of the **geolocation spectrum database** that powered Ghana’s first large-scale **TV White Space (TVWS)** trial, supported by the **UK’s EPSRC** and submitted to the **Ghana’s National Communications Authority (NCA)**.
